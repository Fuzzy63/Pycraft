It is a simple minecraft clone made using python and the ursina engine.

You need Python 3.9 or later and some libraries:
ursina
perlin noise


All music tracks were made by me using musecore. Sweden is a remix of the orginal sweden from minecraft.

Thanks to Mojang.

All code was made by me. If you wish to use any of this code in your projects, have at it. Its as simple as it can get but its a little messy. I will update this every once in a while.

Shaders are as simple as can be to reduce cpu load. It is a little broken. 

I am using the psutil library to check pc load. thats all. check the code if you are unsure.
